# OIBSIP_DataAnalytics_Task3
## Sentiment Analysis 
 Project Overview
This project focuses on text data analysis and visualization to extract meaningful insights from textual datasets. The main objective is to analyze text-based data, identify patterns, and present results visually for better understanding.
The project demonstrates how data analytics techniques can transform raw text into useful information for decision-making.

## Objective
The primary goal is to develop a system that can analyze textual data and generate insights such as:


Frequently occurring words


Patterns in listing descriptions


Useful trends from textual information



 ## Project Idea
Sentiment Analysis & Text Mining
The project explores how Natural Language Processing (NLP) and data visualization techniques can be used to:


Understand text content


Identify meaningful keywords


Extract trends from datasets



 ## Dataset
Datasets used in this project:https://1drv.ms/x/c/9634055C5C14C0EE/IQA9XuQ4vyyTRZptBU6XfWapAe1wzS0T0xfwoMgMs-bjv5E?e=RTlffP



## Technologies Used


Python


Pandas


Matplotlib


WordCloud


Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook



🔍 Methodology
Steps followed in this analysis:


Data Collection
Imported dataset containing textual records.




Data Cleaning
Removed null values
Converted data into string format
Filtered relevant text columns




Text Processing
Combined text entries
Prepared corpus for analysis




Visualization
Generated word cloud visualization
Highlighted most frequent words





## Visualization Insight 


The Word Cloud shows the most frequently used words in listings. Larger words represent higher frequency, revealing:


Common property types


Popular locations


Frequently used descriptive terms


This helps identify trends in how listings are described.

## Key Concepts Applied


Sentiment Analysis basics


Natural Language Processing (NLP)


Feature Extraction


Machine Learning Concepts


Data Visualization Techniques



## Challenges Faced


Cleaning unstructured text data


Handling missing values


Selecting meaningful text features


Visualizing text frequency effectively



## Outcome
The project successfully demonstrates how textual data can be analyzed and visualized to uncover useful insights. It highlights how analytics techniques help interpret large volumes of text efficiently.
